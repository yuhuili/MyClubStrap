## Inspiration
Club registration at McGill and Waterloo is a hassle. There is not a central platform for students to sign up and for clubs to manage their members.

## What it does
**My Club Strap** allows students to join clubs in their school and to browse events happening in the school.

## How we built it
We used bootstrap and JQuery for UI, Firebase for database and user authentication.

## Challenges we ran into
Firebase rules were difficult to deal with because of its steep learning rules. Also we had to keep pages organized and to have a smooth overall feel.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The design looks amazing. We managed to get many core features done that are essential to a club registration system.

## What we learned
We learned to collaborate in a team to work on different parts of the project, as well as different technologies.

## What's next for My Club Strap
We need a richer environment for admin to manage the clubs, an access portal for sponsors.
